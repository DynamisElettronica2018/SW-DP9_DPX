/**      \file dd_interfaces.h
*        \brief Defines all interfaces which can be displayed and the relative drawing routines.
*
*        For each Interface defined a function \code void dd_Interface_print<InterfaceName>(void)\endcode
*        which defines the drawing operations to print the specific Interface on screen, must be defined along with it
*        to be called by the \link dd_graphic_controller.h graphic controller\endlink on frame rate schedule.
*        A pointer to each function must be added to the dd_Interface_print array in the same order as the interfaces are
*        defined, for the Graphic Controller to be able to access them correctly.
*        In the same way a \code void dd_Interface_init<InterfaceName>(void)\endcode method can be defined, which is called once
*        each time the Interface is set, providing custom initialization logic for the Interface.
*        These must be added to dd_Interface_init array and the same rules apply as for print methods.
*        If no initialization is required then a NULL pointer can be specified. Providing a non-NULL valid print method
*        is instead mandatory.
*        These specific interface members are defined externally for Menu and Dashboard interfaces, where linked below.
*                 Every interface is displayed with a title in a common routine, and then allowed to draw its own graphics in the print routine.
*        
*                 All interfaces which can be set explicitly are collection based, meaning they represent a collection of indicator data.
*        Dashboard and Menu belong to this category.
*        To draw themselves they must be provided with an indicator collection. This collection is stored elsewhere in memory,
*        and a pointer is passed to the graphic controller when the Interface is set via
*        dd_GraphicController_setCollectionInterface() and is later stored for usage by the interfaces.
*                 In the same method the title to be displayed is set.
*        
*        Other interfaces may exist, such as the Notification interface, which do not depend on indicator collections.
*        These are managed automatically and privately by the graphic controller and are not directly accessible by the user,
*        if not via specific methods which are provided by dd_graphic_controller.h, as dd_GraphicController_fireTimedNotification().
*                 The notification interface displays a different title from #dd_notificationTitles,
*                 according to the #NotificationType selected. It is important that titles and definitions be ordered
*                 coherently.
*
*        \sa dd_dashboard.h, dd_menu.h and dd_graphic_controller.h
