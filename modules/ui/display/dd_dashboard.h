        \brief Dashboard interface.

The \link dd_dashboard.h dashboard\endlink is a collection interface,
it presents #DASHBOARD_INDICATORS_COUNT number of indicators in
distinct positions of the display, as defined in #DashboardPosition.
The dashboard is not interactive, but only serves the purpose of displaying information on screen.
Typically this information will regard the car's parameters, such as cooling water temperature, EBB
setting and so on. Of each indicator its name and its value label will be displayed. If the Indicator's "parseValueLabel" field
is set the indicators' labels are automatically parsed from their typed values. However the initial label is not overwritten
unless the value has changed since.

Indicators displayed are set together with the interface through dd_GraphicController_setCollectionInterface()
and are assumed to be ordered matching the positions indexes.
If the collection passed is longer than the number of indicators which can be displayed the dashboard will access
the first which are necessary.
